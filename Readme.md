# Convolutional Neural Network and Google's QuickDraw Dataset

## Main Pakages used - 
1. Python
2. Keras
3. h5py
4. matplotlib
5. numpy
6. open-cv
7. pandas
8. scikit-learn
9. scipy etc.

Steps:
1.  dataLoad.py - Loads the training data
2.  trainModel.py - Trains the model on the loaded data. The data consists of 15 classes in .npy format. Additional classes can be added in .npy format from the QuickDraw Dataset.
3.  quickDrawApp.py - OpenCV app where webcam is used to capture input and predict sketches in real time.
